Apologies, but it appears that the task is not clearly defined as "uy a bag". There might be a typo. Could you please clarify? If the task is to "buy a bag", the initial problem domain does not cover buying actions. However, if you'd like a problem domain introduced where the goal is to acquire a bag, it can be done. We would just need to modify the domain file to include an action like "buy" or "acquire".
