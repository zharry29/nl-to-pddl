Sure, here is a PDDL problem file in Python format for the "sleep in shelter" task:

```
from py2pddl import goal, init

class JungleSurvivalProblem3(JungleSurvivalDomain):

    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.humans = JungleSurvivalDomain.Human.create_objs(["explorer3"])
        self.shelters = JungleSurvivalDomain.Shelter.create_objs(["shelter3"])

    @init
    def init(self):
        return [self.at_shelter(self.humans["explorer3"], self.shelters["shelter3"])]

    @goal
    def goal(self):
        return []
```

In this problem file, the goal is to sleep in the shelter. Therefore the initial state includes the human being at the shelter, while there is no designated goal state as sleeping in the shelter is a process rather than a state.
