Certainly! Here is the PDDL code for the fourth problem file "ultimate-win":

```pddl
(define (problem ultimate-win)
   (:domain shark-defense)

   (:objects
      swimmer - person
      shark - shark
   )

   (:init
      (at swimmer)
      (at shark)
   )

   (:goal
      (and
         (not (attacking shark))
         (not (injured swimmer))
         (reached-shore)
         (medical-attention swimmer)
      )
   )
)
```

In this problem, the goal is to achieve the ultimate win by ensuring the safety of the swimmer. The initial state specifies the presence of the swimmer and the shark. The goal state requires that the shark is not attacking, the swimmer is not injured, the swimmer has reached the shore, and the swimmer has received medical attention.
