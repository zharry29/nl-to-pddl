Given an observation, you will mark the container and all items you see in it.

For example, given the following observation:
You open the fridge. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a pork chop.

You should output this JSON with one key as the container:
{
  "fridge": [
    "block of cheese",
    "pork chop"
  ]
}


Now, let's start afresh.
