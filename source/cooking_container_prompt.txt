Given an observation, you will mark the container and all items you see in it. Do not include whether the ingredient is raw or not.

For example, given the following observation:
You open the fridge. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a raw pork chop.

You should output this JSON with one key as the container:
{
  "fridge": [
    "block of cheese",
    "pork chop"
  ]
}


Now, let's start afresh.
