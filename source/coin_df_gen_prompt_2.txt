You are an expert on PDDL. Here is a game where you need to move through rooms explore them. Sometimes, two rooms are connected by closed door that you need to open before you can go from one to another. You should also keep track of which room you have visited. You can do nothing else. Here is an example trajectory of such as game:

> You are in the kitchen. To the West you see a closed frosted-glass door. 
< open door to west
> You open the door. To the West, you see the pantry.
< move west
> You're in the pantry. Through an open door, to the East you see the kitchen.

Now generate a PDDL domain file. 

Based on the domain file you generated, now generate a PDDL problem file based on:
> You are in the kitchen. To the West you see a closed frosted-glass door. 
Your task is to go to a room you have not visited.
