There a simulated kitchen environment where an agent need to cook a meal using the ingredients it has. 

You are given the following basic domain file about navigation:
(define (domain environment)
  (:requirements :strips :typing :negative-preconditions :disjunctive-preconditions)
  (:types
    location
    direction
  )
  (:predicates
    (at ?loc - location)
    (visited ?loc - location)
    (connected ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
    (closed_door ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)
  )

  (:action move
    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
    :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (connected ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir) (not (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2)))
    :effect (and (not (at ?loc1)) (at ?loc2))
  )

  (:action open_door
    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)
    :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2))
    :effect (not (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2))
  )
)

Your job is to observe an agent in this environment and build on the domain file. Your domain file should include the following actions:
- chop: use a knife to make something chopped
- slice: use a knife to make something sliced
- dice: use a knife to make something diced
- use_stove: use a stove to make something fried
- use_toaster: use a stove to make something grilled
- use_oven: use a stove to make something roasted

Your domain file should work with the following example problem file:
