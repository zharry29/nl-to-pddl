You are an expert in PDDL. You are provided with the following PDDL domain file about navigating through a kitchen environment.

(define (domain environment)
  (:requirements :strips :typing :negative-preconditions :disjunctive-preconditions)
  (:types
    location
    direction
  )
  (:predicates
    (at ?loc - location)
    (visited ?loc - location)
    (connected ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
    (closed_door ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)
  )

  (:action move
    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
    :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (connected ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir) (not (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2)))
    :effect (and (not (at ?loc1)) (at ?loc2))
  )

  (:action open_door
    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)
    :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2))
    :effect (not (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2))
  )

Next, you will observe a trajectory of an agent:
< examine cookbook
> Gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.

Ingredients:
  flour
  cilantro

Directions:
  dice the cilantro
  prepare meal


< look around
> You are in the kitchen. In one part of the room you see a stove. There is also an oven. You also see a toaster. In another part of the room you see a fridge that is closed. In one part of the room you see a counter that has a knife, and a cookbook on it. There is also a kitchen cupboard that is closed. You also see a cutlery drawer that is closed. In another part of the room you see a trash can that is closed. In one part of the room you see a dishwasher that is closed. There is also a dining chair, that has nothing on it. 
To the West you see a closed frosted-glass door. 
< open fridge
> You open the fridge. The fridge contains some cilantro.
< take cilantro
> You take the cilantro.
< take knife
> You take the knife.
< open kitchen cupboard
> You open the kitchen cupboard. It's empty inside.
< open cutlery drawer
> You open the cutlery drawer. It's empty inside.
< open trash can
> You open the trash can. It's empty inside.
< open dishwasher
> You open the dishwasher. It's empty inside.
> open door to west
> move west
< take flour
> You take the flour.
> move east
> dice cilantro
> prepare meal


Now, you need to do 3 things.
#1. Describe in natural language the names of the new actions, and the preconditions and effects of each.
#2. Expand upon the given domain file about navigation by adding the new actions you see in this trajectory. Provide the new domain file.
#3. Provide a problem file that assumes you're in the kitchen and have all ingredients and tools. Your task is to prepare the meal.

Let's start with #1. Please describe in natural language the names of the new actions, and the preconditions and effects of each. Be concise.
