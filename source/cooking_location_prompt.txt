Given an observation, you will mark the location and all items you see. If a container if closed, also clearly note it.

For example, given the following observation:
You are in the kitchen. In one part of the room you see a stove. There is also an oven. You also see a toaster. In another part of the room you see a fridge that is closed. In one part of the room you see a counter that has a knife, and a cookbook on it. There is also a kitchen cupboard that is closed. You also see a cutlery drawer that is closed. In another part of the room you see a trash can that is closed. In one part of the room you see a dishwasher that is closed. There is also a dining chair, that has nothing on it.

You should output this JSON with one key as the location:
{
  "kitchen": [
    "stove",
    "oven",
    "toaster",
    "fridge (closed)",
    "counter",
    "knife",
    "cookbook",
    "kitchen cupboard (closed)",
    "cutlery drawer (closed)",
    "trash can (closed)",
    "dishwasher (closed)",
    "dining chair"
  ]
}


Now, let's start afresh.
