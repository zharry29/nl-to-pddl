Sure, here are the respective PDDL domain and problem files for the task.

PDDL Domain File:

```
(define (domain snack)
(:requirements :strips :typing :negative-preconditions)
(:types
    place - object
    food - object
)
(:predicates
    (at ?x - place)
    (in ?x - food ?y - place)
    (holding ?x - food)
)
(:action find
    :parameters (?f - food ?p - place)
    :precondition (in ?f ?p)
    :effect (and (not (in ?f ?p)) (holding ?f))
)
(:action go
    :parameters (?from - place ?to - place)
    :precondition (at ?from)
    :effect (and (not (at ?from)) (at ?to))
)
(:action pick
    :parameters (?f - food ?p - place)
    :precondition (and (at ?p) (in ?f ?p))
    :effect (and (not (in ?f ?p)) (holding ?f))
)
(:action put
    :parameters (?f - food ?p - place)
    :precondition (and (at ?p) (holding ?f))
    :effect (and (not (holding ?f)) (in ?f ?p))
)
)
```

PDDL Problem File:

```
(define (problem snack-problem)
(:domain snack)
(:objects
    user - place
    counter - place
    table - place
    initial - place
    kettle-chips - food
    multigrain-chips - food
    jalapeno-chips - food
    rice-chips - food
)
(:init 
    (at initial)
    (in kettle-chips table)
    (in multigrain-chips counter)
    (in jalapeno-chips counter)
    (in rice-chips table)
)
(:goal (in kettle-chips user))
)
```

Note: In this case, kettle-chips are assumed to be a salty snack.
