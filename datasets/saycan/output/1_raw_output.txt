Sure, first let's define the PDDL domain file and then the PDDL problem file.

PDDL Domain File:

```
(define (domain household)
    (:requirements :strips :typing)
    (:types
        location
        item
    )
    (:predicates
        (at ?x - location)
        (located ?i - item ?x - location)
    )

    (:action find
        :parameters (?i - item ?x - location)
        :precondition (at ?x)
        :effect (located ?i ?x)
    )

    (:action go
        :parameters (?x - location)
        :effect (and 
                 (at ?x)
                 (not (at (not ?x)))
         )
    )

    (:action pick
        :parameters (?i - item ?x - location)
        :precondition (and (at ?x) (located ?i ?x))
        :effect (not (located ?i ?x))
    )

    (:action put
        :parameters (?i - item ?x - location)
        :precondition (at ?x)
        :effect (located ?i ?x)
    )
)
```
PDDL Problem File:

```
(define (problem task)
    (:domain household)
    (:objects
        table counter - location
    )
    (:init 
        (at initial)
    )
    (:goal 
        (and 
            (at table)
            (at counter)
        )
    )
)
```

Remember, this is a very basic representation. You might want to add more details and vary the task as per necessity.
