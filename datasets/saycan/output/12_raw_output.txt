In this domain and problem, the "find" action enables the robot to find a particular food item in a location, whereas the "pick" action allows the robot to pick up the discovered food. The "go" action represents the robot moving between different locations, and the "put" action represents the robot putting down a food currently being held. Note that the robot can only hold one food item at a time. The robot is asked to find and pick up a spicy food, which in this case is jalapeno chips. The task is considered successful once the robot is holding a spicy food.
