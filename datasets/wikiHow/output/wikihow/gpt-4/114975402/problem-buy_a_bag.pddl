Absolutely. Here's an instance of a problem "buy a bag":

```
(define (problem problem-3-buy-bag)
  (:domain detective)
  (:objects bag1 - object)
  (:init
  )
  (:goal (bag bag1))
)
```

This problem is quite straightforward, aiming to purchase a single bag, named bag1, and is considered solved once this task is achieved.
