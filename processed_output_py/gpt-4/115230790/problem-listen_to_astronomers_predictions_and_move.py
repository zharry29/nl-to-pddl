I'm sorry for the confusion but "isten to astronomers predictions and move" does not seem to align with the PDDL domain file provided. The domain file includes concepts such as survivors, locations, supplies, and bunkers, but there are no actions or predicates that pertain to listening to astronomers or predictions. Therefore, it's not possible to create a problem file based on this task with the given domain file. Could you please provide more details or clarify the task?
